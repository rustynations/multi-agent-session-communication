# Changelog

Versions match the `<!-- Version: YYYY-MM-DD.N -->` comment at the top of `SKILL.md`, so you
can tell at a glance which release your copy is on.

You update by pulling:

```bash
cd <wherever you cloned this>
git pull
```

**Entries marked 🔴 ACTION REQUIRED need something from you beyond a pull** — a habit to change,
or a running session to correct. Everything else takes effect on its own.

## 2026-09-05.6 — correction

**Reverted the identity-naming guidance added in `.3`.** It told agents to use short names and
offered `ARCH` / `BUILD` / `REV`. That was a whole rule invented from one human typo, it made the
thread harder to read, and it cost context in every session that loaded the skill.

Use readable role names — `ARCHITECT`, `BUILDER`, `REVIEWER`. Nothing further.

The near-miss warning added in `.3` is also **removed** from `poll-issue.sh`. A human mistyping a
name is not the skill's problem to solve, and making an agent stop and interpret a warning about
it was worse than the typo.

---

## 2026-09-05.5 — 🟡 recommended change

**Pushing a branch you do not have checked out leaves your local ref stale.** Caught at the close
of the founding sprint.

The reviewer promoted with `git push origin <sha>:main` while standing on `staging`. That updates
the remote and `origin/main` — but **not** the local `main` pointer. GitHub was correct the whole
time and the working copy was not, so the next session would check out `main`, see the old commit,
and conclude prod was behind.

After any push you did not make from that branch:

```
git fetch origin
git rev-parse main origin/main                 # must match
git ls-remote origin main                      # and match GitHub
git update-ref refs/heads/main origin/main     # only if it does not
```

Purely local. Nothing needs pushing — the remote was already right.

---

## 2026-09-05.4 — 🟡 recommended change

**Run the watcher in the background.** No code changed; this is the best structural finding of
the founding audit, and it is worth acting on.

```
"$POLL" watch "$ISSUE" "$ME" "$REPO" "$WM"    # ← run this in the BACKGROUND
```

In Claude Code that is `run_in_background` or `ctrl+b`. You are re-invoked when it returns, so
you lose nothing — and you gain the single best property in the protocol: **you keep listening
AND stay reachable at the same time.**

A foreground watcher makes your session unreachable for ~9 minutes at a stretch. Your human
cannot ask you anything, and if you stop to prompt them you go **deaf** (rule 7).

Measured, not theoretical. In the founding sprint all three working agents polled in the
**foreground**; two went deaf on a prompt and one had to be freed by hand. The observer polled
in the **background**, talked to its human throughout, and never missed a comment — including
one that a foreground watcher had already discarded.

Rule 7 is the seatbelt. Backgrounding is not crashing. **Prefer the structural fix.**

---

## 2026-09-05.3 — 🔴 ACTION REQUIRED

The rest of the findings from the same live audit — a full three-agent sprint watched end to end
by a read-only observer comparing the thread against every agent's local transcript.

### 🔴 What you must change

**1. The stop token is now `[SESSION DONE]` — in brackets, matched anywhere.**

```
[SESSION DONE]        ← ends the session, position does not matter
SESSION DONE          ← no longer does anything (but watch SHOUTS if it sees one)
```

Brackets are already the signal namespace, so a bracketed stop can never be mistaken for prose —
and the bare phrase is now inert, so you can finally discuss the stop word safely. The reverse
also holds: **writing `[SESSION DONE]` in prose will stop everyone**, exactly like a stray
`@handle` pings a stranger.

The old form fails **loudly**, never silently: a session already running holds the previous skill
text in its context even after the repo updates, so an agent can still emit the old form believing
it closed the session.

**2. Address the agent who ACTS, not just the agent who asked.**

A human approved a prod promotion, addressed to the coordinator who had asked. The agent that
actually pushes — the reviewer — was not named, so its `watch` classified the approval as
not-for-it, marked it seen and **discarded it**. It then correctly refused to push, holding for an
approval that already existed and that it could never receive. The sender got no error. Announce
any decision, release or authorization to `[all]`.

**3.** *(This entry originally added identity-naming rules and a near-miss warning. Both were
reverted in `.6` — see above.)*

### Added
- **Loud warning for the old stop format**, so its removal can never be a silent no-op.
- **"Closing the session — drain the thread first."** With several agents writing at once a close
  always races them. Observed inside 14 seconds: a builder raised an unverified check, the
  coordinator closed 4 seconds later, and the reviewer posted the very verification the close
  depended on 10 seconds after that. Post a last call, `watch` through it, `peek` immediately
  before closing, and answer or explicitly defer every open item.
- **`gh issue close` exits 0 on an already-closed issue.** Check `state` **and** `closedAt` —
  a coordinator reported "closing now" when the issue had been closed 12 minutes earlier, before
  the work had even finished.
- **"Authority scales with reversibility."** A relay is fine for a preference, never for a
  one-way action. Also: check whether a push *is* the deploy before you gate it — a pipeline
  watching `main` makes it one.
- **"If you write the spec: numbering is not ordering."** `W1…W6` invites everyone to read the
  numbers as the running order; a verification step often has to run after a later-numbered
  deploy. State the chronology separately.
- **Three proactive verification habits**, all from this sprint: rehearse against the **old**
  build so a broken probe can never look like a broken feature; capture the "before" number
  while it still exists; and read the **uncommitted** tree rather than the diff after the commit.
  Plus: **name the checks you skip on purpose** — a skipped check and a forgotten one look
  identical in the record.
- **`--paginate` warning.** `gh api .../comments` returns only the first **30** comments, so a
  hand-written check silently stops seeing recent ones. This bit the auditor of this very sprint,
  which declared a decision missing from a query structurally unable to see it. `watch`, `peek`
  and `audit` are all safe; only ad-hoc commands are exposed.
- **The `@$HUMAN` ask is invisible** on a shared login — GitHub cannot notify you of your own
  comment. Post it on the thread, *also* say it in your own window as plain text (never a
  prompt), and go straight back to `watch`.
- A three-mode table of how a message vanishes — orphaned watermark, wrong addressee, mistyped
  name — because all three are silent and each needs a different tell.

### Changed
- **Rule 7 corrected.** It banned blocking prompts outright; the FIRST agent's alignment with the
  human happens before any `watch` and is legitimate. The ban now applies from your first `watch`
  onward — including while "idle", because idle means listening.

---

## 2026-09-05.2 — 🔴 ACTION REQUIRED

**A new golden rule (7): never block on a prompt.** Found in the same live audit, later the
same day.

### 🔴 What you must change

**Do not use `AskUserQuestion`** — or anything else that stops and waits for a person — while in
a multi-agent session. A blocking prompt freezes your session, so **you stop polling** while the
thread still says you are watching. You go deaf and you look fine.

```
# WRONG — you are now deaf, and the thread does not show it
AskUserQuestion("the delete was refused, what should I do?")

# RIGHT
"$POLL" peek  "$ISSUE" "$ME" "$REPO" "$WM" 10   # may already be answered
gh issue comment ... --body "$ME: [ARCHITECT] @$HUMAN blocked on X. Options: A / B."
"$POLL" watch "$ISSUE" "$ME" "$REPO" "$WM"      # go back to listening immediately
```

**What happened:** an agent hit a permission refusal, asked the human a modal question, posted
*"Parked, watching"*, and sat frozen. The coordinator answered **55 seconds later** and the agent
could not receive it. No peer could detect the problem — the thread looked healthy. Only the
human watching that terminal could see it, and had to dismiss the prompt by hand.

Rules 6 and 7 are the same mistake wearing two hats: `SendMessage` leaves **no record**, a
blocking prompt leaves you **deaf**. Both route around the bus.

### Changed
- **Blockers:** post the blocker, then go **straight back to `watch`**. Do not wait on a prompt,
  and do not assume only the human can unblock you — state the options you can see, because a
  **peer** often answers before the human reads the thread.
- **`peek` before you escalate.** The answer may already be posted, and a refused step may be
  one you do not actually need.
- New mistakes-table rows for all of the above, including: if you are not in `watch`, do not
  claim you are. A false status is worse than silence, because it stops peers looking for the
  problem.

## 2026-09-05.1 — 🔴 ACTION REQUIRED

**Fixes a silent message-loss bug that can deadlock a session with nothing on the thread to
show why.** Found by auditing a real three-agent sprint, which deadlocked four minutes in.

### 🔴 What you must change

**Pass an ABSOLUTE watermark path.** Earlier versions of this skill told you to use a relative
one (`tmp/mas-watermark-...`). That is now wrong.

```bash
# OLD — do not use
WM=tmp/mas-watermark-${ME}-${ISSUE}.txt

# NEW
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude/mas-state"
WM="$HOME/.claude/mas-state/$(printf '%s' "$REPO" | tr '/' '-')-${ISSUE}-${ME}.txt"
```

**Why:** Bash cwd persists between tool calls, so a relative path follows the agent around. One
`cd` into a subdirectory makes the same argument resolve to a **different, empty file** — and an
empty watermark baselines to the newest comment, silently swallowing every message waiting for
you. No error. No warning.

That is what happened: a BUILDER agent ran `init` from the project root, `cd`-ed into a component
repo to read code, and its next `watch` jumped straight past the `[BUILDER] go` that had landed
in between. BUILDER waited forever for a go it had already been sent, the coordinator believed
BUILDER was building, and the reviewer waited on BUILDER. All three agents stopped.

**If a session is running right now:** check for a duplicate watermark. Two files for one agent
and issue means mail was lost.

```bash
find . -name 'mas-watermark-*' -not -path '*/node_modules/*'
```

### Added
- **`peek` mode** — print the recent thread **without** consuming mail, so your next `watch`
  still delivers everything it would have. The skill already required a re-read before
  committing but shipped no command for it.
  ```
  "$POLL" peek "$ISSUE" "$ME" "$REPO" "$WM" 10
  ```
- **`audit` mode** — returns **every** new or edited comment instead of only yours, for an
  observer watching the session itself. Your own comments never wake you. `watch` cannot do
  this job: it discards anything not addressed to you, which is exactly the agent-to-agent
  traffic an observer exists to see.
- **Observer role** documented in `SKILL.md`: use `audit`, announce once, then stay silent, and
  never post the stop word.
- **"When a message goes missing"** section — how to spot lost mail (two watermark files for one
  agent is the proof) and three recovery rules: **rewind** the watermark rather than copying the
  broken value forward, re-send the **full** message rather than just the trigger word, and say
  on the thread that it was lost, not withheld.

### Changed
- A missing watermark on an issue that already has comments now prints a **loud banner** with
  recovery steps instead of silently baselining to newest.
- Every call prints the **resolved absolute** watermark path as its first line, so a cwd drift
  is visible immediately.
- `watch` now flags a comment `*** EDITED AFTER YOU SAW IT ***`. The watermark only tracked
  `createdAt`, so an edited spec was invisible and every agent kept building from stale text.
- `watch` reminds you to read the **whole** batch: one return can hold several messages, and a
  later one may cancel an earlier one.

### Compatibility
Script changes are **additive**. Exit codes (`0` / `10` / `42`), the watermark file format, and
the `watch` fetch path are unchanged, so a session already in progress picks this up safely —
verified against three live agents mid-sprint.

---

## 2026-09-04.3 — 🔴 ACTION REQUIRED

### 🔴 What you must change

**Address agents in square brackets, never with `@`.** `@` is reserved for real GitHub accounts.

```
[Reviewer] your gate list is right      ← correct
@Reviewer  your gate list is right      ← notifies a stranger
```

Any obvious agent name is also somebody's real GitHub handle, so `@`-mentioning one on a public
issue pings an uninvolved person. No prefix is safe — `agent-` handles are taken too. Brackets
belong to no namespace, so they never collide.

**Derive your human's handle, never guess it:** `HUMAN=$(gh api user -q .login)`. A short nickname
that looks like your human's handle usually belongs to a different real person.

### Changed
- **`SendMessage` is banned.** The issue is the only channel. Direct session-to-session messages
  leave no record: your human cannot read them, a restarted agent cannot recover them, and an
  agent on another machine never sees them. Blocked on a peer? Post the blocker on the thread
  **and** ask your human in your own window.
- The stop word only matches `SESSION DONE` **on its own line**. A mention inside a sentence used
  to false-trigger every watcher.

### Docs
- "See it in action" section with demo screenshots (hosted as release assets, not in the repo).

## 2026-09-03.1 — first release

- The skill, the six golden rules, and `poll-issue.sh` with `init` and `watch`.
- Blocking poller: spends zero LLM tokens while waiting, returns only on mail for you (exit `0`),
  a stop signal (exit `42`), or a timeout (exit `10` → just run it again).
- Text-based addressing, because all agents share one GitHub login.
- **"When a verification looks alarming — cheapest check FIRST"** — do the one cheap check that
  could disprove the alarm before anyone theorises. In a multi-agent session, agents amplify each
  other's theories, and two confident wrong reads in a row is the tell.
