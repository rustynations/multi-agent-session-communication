# Changelog

Versions match the `<!-- Version: YYYY-MM-DD.N -->` comment at the top of `SKILL.md`, so you
can tell at a glance which release your copy is on.

You update by pulling:

```bash
cd <wherever you cloned this>
git pull
```

**Entries marked 🔴 ACTION REQUIRED need something from you beyond a pull** — a habit to change,
or a running session to correct. Everything else takes effect on its own.

## 2026-09-05.1 — 🔴 ACTION REQUIRED

**Fixes a silent message-loss bug that can deadlock a session with nothing on the thread to
show why.** Found by auditing a real three-agent sprint, which deadlocked four minutes in.

### 🔴 What you must change

**Pass an ABSOLUTE watermark path.** Earlier versions of this skill told you to use a relative
one (`tmp/mas-watermark-...`). That is now wrong.

```bash
# OLD — do not use
WM=tmp/mas-watermark-${ME}-${ISSUE}.txt

# NEW
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude/mas-state"
WM="$HOME/.claude/mas-state/$(printf '%s' "$REPO" | tr '/' '-')-${ISSUE}-${ME}.txt"
```

**Why:** Bash cwd persists between tool calls, so a relative path follows the agent around. One
`cd` into a subdirectory makes the same argument resolve to a **different, empty file** — and an
empty watermark baselines to the newest comment, silently swallowing every message waiting for
you. No error. No warning.

That is what happened: a BUILDER agent ran `init` from the project root, `cd`-ed into a component
repo to read code, and its next `watch` jumped straight past the `[BUILDER] go` that had landed
in between. BUILDER waited forever for a go it had already been sent, the coordinator believed
BUILDER was building, and the reviewer waited on BUILDER. All three agents stopped.

**If a session is running right now:** check for a duplicate watermark. Two files for one agent
and issue means mail was lost.

```bash
find . -name 'mas-watermark-*' -not -path '*/node_modules/*'
```

### Added
- **`peek` mode** — print the recent thread **without** consuming mail, so your next `watch`
  still delivers everything it would have. The skill already required a re-read before
  committing but shipped no command for it.
  ```
  "$POLL" peek "$ISSUE" "$ME" "$REPO" "$WM" 10
  ```
- **`audit` mode** — returns **every** new or edited comment instead of only yours, for an
  observer watching the session itself. Your own comments never wake you. `watch` cannot do
  this job: it discards anything not addressed to you, which is exactly the agent-to-agent
  traffic an observer exists to see.
- **Observer role** documented in `SKILL.md`: use `audit`, announce once, then stay silent, and
  never post the stop word.
- **"When a message goes missing"** section — how to spot lost mail (two watermark files for one
  agent is the proof) and three recovery rules: **rewind** the watermark rather than copying the
  broken value forward, re-send the **full** message rather than just the trigger word, and say
  on the thread that it was lost, not withheld.

### Changed
- A missing watermark on an issue that already has comments now prints a **loud banner** with
  recovery steps instead of silently baselining to newest.
- Every call prints the **resolved absolute** watermark path as its first line, so a cwd drift
  is visible immediately.
- `watch` now flags a comment `*** EDITED AFTER YOU SAW IT ***`. The watermark only tracked
  `createdAt`, so an edited spec was invisible and every agent kept building from stale text.
- `watch` reminds you to read the **whole** batch: one return can hold several messages, and a
  later one may cancel an earlier one.

### Compatibility
Script changes are **additive**. Exit codes (`0` / `10` / `42`), the watermark file format, and
the `watch` fetch path are unchanged, so a session already in progress picks this up safely —
verified against three live agents mid-sprint.

## 2026-09-04.3 — 🔴 ACTION REQUIRED

### 🔴 What you must change

**Address agents in square brackets, never with `@`.** `@` is reserved for real GitHub accounts.

```
[Reviewer] your gate list is right      ← correct
@Reviewer  your gate list is right      ← notifies a stranger
```

Any obvious agent name is also somebody's real GitHub handle, so `@`-mentioning one on a public
issue pings an uninvolved person. No prefix is safe — `agent-` handles are taken too. Brackets
belong to no namespace, so they never collide.

**Derive your human's handle, never guess it:** `HUMAN=$(gh api user -q .login)`. A short nickname
that looks like your human's handle usually belongs to a different real person.

### Changed
- **`SendMessage` is banned.** The issue is the only channel. Direct session-to-session messages
  leave no record: your human cannot read them, a restarted agent cannot recover them, and an
  agent on another machine never sees them. Blocked on a peer? Post the blocker on the thread
  **and** ask your human in your own window.
- The stop word only matches `SESSION DONE` **on its own line**. A mention inside a sentence used
  to false-trigger every watcher.

### Docs
- "See it in action" section with demo screenshots (hosted as release assets, not in the repo).

## 2026-09-03.1 — first release

- The skill, the six golden rules, and `poll-issue.sh` with `init` and `watch`.
- Blocking poller: spends zero LLM tokens while waiting, returns only on mail for you (exit `0`),
  a stop signal (exit `42`), or a timeout (exit `10` → just run it again).
- Text-based addressing, because all agents share one GitHub login.
- **"When a verification looks alarming — cheapest check FIRST"** — do the one cheap check that
  could disprove the alarm before anyone theorises. In a multi-agent session, agents amplify each
  other's theories, and two confident wrong reads in a row is the tell.
